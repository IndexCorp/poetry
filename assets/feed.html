<div class="page" data-page-number="1" data-loaded="true">
<div class="textLayer">
<div>I have read the news differently ever since:</div>
<div>the names, the numbers. Nothing</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>exists now that isn&#8217;t a reminder of trauma.</div>
<div>Even the term for this is <em>trigger</em>.</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>I pick up the phone. Such few times</div>
<div>I’ve heard my father’s voice like this.</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>And the word he uses: <em>shot</em>. So mundane</div>
<div>until it’s married to someone you love.</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>The flash I saw, the blinding white-</div>
<div>silver of shock, as if it presented a portal,</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>a wink from the multiverse, in which</div>
<div>everything is covered by the veil of <em>what if</em>.</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>The first recorded use of a gun</div>
<div>was in 1364, a leap year. Leap to</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>any future date and find a record</div>
<div>of sorrow in every second since.</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>Long before the gun, Ancient Greeks</div>
<div>theorized infinite worlds. Sometime later,</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>Schrödinger appears. From there,</div>
<div>we step back about a century—</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>there is no good news here, except</div>
<div>that metaphysics doesn’t speak</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>in amendments. Which is to say—</div>
<div>or rather, which is to theorize</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>an alternate reality. One in which</div>
<div>my brother isn’t bleach splattered</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>under x-ray, one in which his friends</div>
<div>survive. A place in which I can freely pop</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" data-page-number="2" data-loaded="true">
<div class="textLayer">
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>my bubblegum without transporting</div>
<div>my father-in-law back to the battlefield.</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>In this heaven, there is no word for bullet.</div>
<div>But who can possibly believe in heaven</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>when Schrödinger points his gun</div>
<div>at every locked box he sees?</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>And to think these are our success stories:</div>
<div>the invention of violence</div>
<div><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></div>
<div>our people’s greatest innovation.</div>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I tend to get nervous faced with the impulse to begin an article by tracing etymology. To frame a word within the context of its development through language over time risks eliminating all the ways it has been experienced throughout history by the people who heard it, who read it, who touched it, who wrote it down, and who spoke it for themselves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ways they might have loved or hated its sound, may have stumbled across it one day while reading a book or listening to a story and had it rattle around in their head for weeks on end, the way they might have forgotten it and then, years later, in an offhand moment or deliberate strain at memory have it return, like an old friend or unlikely season.</strong></p>
<p><strong>At the risk of leaving all this out, <i>erode</i>, in the earliest form to which we can trace it, comes from the latin, <i>erodere</i>. It means to wear, or to gnaw away at. The word’s etymology denotes a connection not just to the environmental, but also the personal. And, of course, this makes sense. The wearing away of the world, on the scale with which we have come to observe and contribute to it in our lives today, is commensurate with our own wearing away as well.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The idea of gnawing away, too, offers a new understanding of what it means to erode. It takes the mind to consumption, on a mass scale and private ones. It makes me think of our globalized, unsustainable modes of consumption-production, as well as what eats at me, the hunger-outside-myself within me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Despite the latent risk etymology possesses of occluding the very thing it seeks to clarify — our understanding of how a word has been experienced by others throughout time — it can transform our experience of the world as well, estranging us to words we felt familiar with, allowing for meanings more personal and previously unconsidered to emerge, or, in an ideal situation, some confluence of the two.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For all it holds, in possibilities for the collective and the personal, for the season it is here in this state, where the erosion of earth has most recently led to the Alisal fire in Santa Barbara county, to say nothing of any fire elsewhere, which feeds the air here, which is what permits me and so many others to live, though the sense of precariousness increases, and it is that ever more frequently ashen wind of consumption and production that blows down my street, sending, panicle by precious panicle, the flowers of the california buckeyes to the ground. This month’s Poetry We Admire is dedicated to the poetry of erosion<i>, </i>and the poets who write the poems.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #ff9900;">I am learning which trees are likely to falter,<br />
that the dogwood goes down and extends its roots at the very same time.<br />
</span></p>
<pre style="text-align: center;"><strong>from "<a href="http://www.hoppermag.org/i-am-learning">I am Learning</a>"</strong></pre>
<p style="text-align: center;">by Suzanne Swanson in <em>Hopper Mag</em></p>
<p>I admire Swanson’s poem for the way it succeeds not just at being a poem of erosion — of slow endings and final moments — but also one of preservation and life, in the growth it witnesses, the learning it professes to, and all it notices, from “the women who pause for my Columbine and wild ginger,” to every molecule “pitching a different dance.”</p>
<hr />
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #ff9900;">Where the past meets the day&#8217;s magnetosphere<br />
a hectic body, growing older and more unknown</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="caret-color: #ff9900;">          as the mood turns</span></span></p>
<pre style="text-align: center;"><strong>from "<a href="https://aprweb.org/poems/poem-for-feeling-s-sake8">Poem for Feeling's Sake</a>"</strong></pre>
<p style="text-align: center;">by Wendy Xu in <i>American Poetry Review</i></p>
<p>The syntactical structures of Xu’s poem keep me off balance in a way that delights me, even as its subject matter points my mind in more grim directions. Erosion feels a more private act in the beginning and middle of this poem, with lines like “Morning with a feeling to walk / Limbs churning through air and the traffic so polite” and “Who am I to think about philosophy, money?” retaining a sense not just of self, but of the self-imposition of limits. These self-impositions never feel far from view in Xu’s poem. Imagery like “my sweltering private factory” and “infallible satellites” transforming the modes of production we have come to depend upon as consumers into images we might empathize with or aspire to. This is a poem that leads me to reexamine my own relationship to the very modes of production eroding the world I inhabit.</p>
<hr />
<pre style="text-align: center;"><strong>"<a href="https://www.ctrlvjournal.com/issue10/noone.html">y.0 page 24</a>"</strong></pre>
<p style="text-align: center;">by no one in <em>ctrl + v journal</em></p>
<p>I had never heard of <i>ctrl + v journal</i> until I stumbled upon it by chance and glee earlier this month, as it offers the opportunity to witness some of the more visually experimental poetry available on the web. Among these, no one’s “y.0 page 24” especially called to mind ideas of erosion. Bits of red string fall atop wheels upon which equations or symbols have been written, resembling clocks whose hands have fallen off-center. Clippings from old and new paper alike adorn the page as well, with letters more legible and faded in kind. Somewhere near the top left corner one can make out “Oyster (I)ceberg”, in the lower right,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>vertically entered, “eye witness.” This is a poem that seems to work to deconstruct not space-time itself, but rather our ideas of what space must cover and be covered by, and, in turn, to challenge our organized systems of time. Such erosion of fixed ideas may be necessary to survive the erosion we are now bearing witness to on earth.</p>
<hr />
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #ff9900;">I spent the night waking to the gasps</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff9900;">of my own cravings.</span></p>
<pre style="text-align: center;"><strong>from "<a href="https://www.terrain.org/2021/poetry/amanda-hawkins-2/">Fire Study</a>"</strong></pre>
<p style="text-align: center;">by Amanda Hawkins in <em>Terrain</em></p>
<p>The imagery and themes in Hawkins’ poem denote erosion more directly than perhaps any of the other four pieces. What brought me back to this piece was not erosion’s primary definition, but what its etymology has to teach us about the meaning of the word. Hawkins’ piece doesn’t stop at examining the decay of the surrounding world, but traces the effects this decay has upon the speaker as well.</p>

<pre style="text-align: center;"><strong>from <a href="https://readwildness.com/27/tbakhi-olive">"Olive Tree Necropastoral"</a></strong></pre>
<p style="text-align: center;">by Fargo Tbakhi in <em>Wildness</em></p>
<p>In Tbakhi’s poem, erosion occurs in ways formal as well as written — the word misshapen takes on a separate form to allow the world a space in which to be more representative of itself, and a second story, told in parentheses on the right margins of the page, is grayer and harder to make out, as though eroded by time or the deliberateness of memory. In this piece, my ideas of erosion, and the relationship between the human and the environment which they call to mind, are inverted. Rather than the ecosystem suffering so that humans may live a certain way, the reverse begins to become true: “and the soil reached / at me with claws / of grass to pull / its way inside / my skin and walk / at last,” for formal reasons, thematic ones, and the sheer innovation of this poem, it felt like a necessary addition to the list.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>In <em>Knee Length</em><i>, </i>poet and journalist Khalisa Rae navigates the nuances of an inherited conservative legacy. Pulling from memories of her religious upbringing and education, family history, and matrilineal teachings, <em>Knee Length</em> is a history reimagined and excavated—a rebellious relearning of desire and respectability, family and faith.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1"><b>&#8220;Oh, God&#8221; is a Testimony </b></p>
<p class="p1">At twelve years old, I am sitting in church with my mother <span class="s1">when suddenly,</span> the wail of the pastor reaches a deep, gut-level, and a woman, overcome with emotion, throws her baby in the air like a wad of dollar bills at a strip club. Yes—she lobs her baby in the air as her arms fling open; we all stop and stare in awe. She is taken with the Spirit, and there’s nothing we can do but watch.</p>
<p class="p1">This <span class="s1">particular</span> Sunday the Spirit is higher, thicker than usual. The organ knows all the notes to sing to get us deep into our feelings. Each note is a punch in the stomach. All the pastor’s words about David and Goliath and overcoming insurmountable obstacles hit and tug on heartstrings that are barely held together with duct tape. The mothers and deaconesses sway and rock, fans in hand, arm raised to the heavens, crying a sorrowful hymnal. Moans, groans, and wails can be heard from every corner like surround sound, and all I can do is look around and soak all this worship and reverence in. The pastor says, “Now, now, you see. When he got ready to craft that slingshot and fight the giant, don’t you think he had doubt in his heart? Don’t you think his hands were shaking? His feet a little wobbly, saints?” Just then the organ hits a call and response note to play up the powerful part of the sermon—the part where the pastor knows he’s talking that shit and “going in.” He steps away from the pulpit to get closer to the crowd and grabs his mic to start screaming. Jerry curl juice dripping like the sweat flying from his forehead. The crowd shouts back, “Yeah!” “Amen!” “Go, ahead.” “Say that!”</p>
<p class="p1">The organ speeds up and just then, the woman—one-year-old baby on her hip—starts to jolt and jerk her body, like she’s convulsing. As the organ gets higher in pitch and faster in tempo, her back buckles and feet stomp. With baby in tow, her hands are moving so quickly now that the rest of her body can’t keep up. My eyes dart to her, mesmerized by her breasts that jostle and move carelessly as if they are dancing with her. They are adornments to the rhythm of her praise. I turn my head away from her for just a moment and turn back to see the baby flying mid-air, still swaddled in a blanket like a football baby Jesus. That&#8217;s right—her baby catapults through the air now like the pastor’s sweat or a wad of spit, and all our eyes follow his soar. The woman next to the baby’s mother watches dumbstruck but reacts just before the baby hits the ground, catching him in her arms like a wide receiver. But the dancing woman is unphased and utterly entranced by the Holy Ghost—by the feeling of deep overwhelm from a spiritual appearance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">I believe our ancestors danced like this. Shook their bottoms and hips and jolted like they were possessed by some otherworldly, magical sensation. But the root wasn’t anything of rituals and sacrifice; it was a dance of celebration. Being overcome with emotion like David. The Bible says David danced out of his clothes, and I know now that this is meant literally. When the Spirit moves through your body, and the chord of the keyboard hits a note that stirs your soul, your shoulders have no choice but to Harlem shake. Your knees can do nothing else but drop low, your butt has to twerk; it’s innate in you. It&#8217;s innate to praise the heavens in a full-body dance.</p>
<p class="p1">This Sunday, we are all transfixed watching her celebratory burst of energy and wailing cry. Her legs hopping like she is walking across a bed of hot coals. Her feet stepping on each note the organ played. And the pastor, her father, egging her on. Slow and methodical, he screeches each word. “Welllllll, when the Lord moves, so does the Spirit. So move, my sistah.” he urges<i>. </i>With each phrase, she lets out a moan that makes my skin flush pink. Goosebumps coat my forearms and shoulders and I fix my eyes on her hips. Her breast and full legs jiggle to the rhythm of <i>Gloryyyyy. Glorrry to God</i>. <i>Yes, yes, yes, God.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i>Praising God with guttural glory. A full body outburst where arms fling open and the head drops back, eyes close, and feet jump.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This is what I imagine sex to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Later, in the car, I ask my mother to explain what happened. I was still a bit mortified by the sight of a baby flying mid-air like a football.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“Why would she do that?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> I asked.</span></p>
<p class="p1">“Sometimes,&#8221; my mother begins, &#8220;you become so overcome with the Spirit that your mind and body get disconnected, ya know?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Like you’re in a trance&#8230;” I nod slowly.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah. Think about a time when the pastor has said something that resonated with you on a spiritual level. You lose all thought or control. Your spirit just <em>feels</em> everything, and wants to cry or move.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"> “But the baby…”</p>
<p class="p1">“She didn’t know what she was doing, sweetheart. The baby is fine.”</p>
<p class="p1">“But what if the woman hadn’t—”</p>
<p class="p1">“Trust, baby girl. The Spirit was high in that place. The baby was covered with holy protection.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I nodded, knowing my mother was right, but I still couldn’t imagine feeling so out of control that your mind doesn’t know what your body is doing.</p>
<p class="p1">“There’s a special warmth and fullness that overtakes you sometimes,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> my mother added.</span></p>
<p class="p1">So much of what my mother said reminded me of women in the movies. The woman’s moans mimicked the love scenes my mom always made me close my eyes for. Two bodies pressed together, with only the warmth of their breath filling the silent spaces. Every time, I would peek through my hands to see what it was my mother was hiding, and every time, a couple was lip-locked on the screen, overcome with emotion. Their cheeks grew flush. Their bodies convulsed and squirmed as if they were possessed. But it was always the woman who would cry out, “Oh God.” And I wondered, are these the same things? Was the woman in the movie taken by the Spirit just like the woman in church?</p>
<p class="p1">Was she yelling out in that passionate moment to thank God for all He had done? Was this pleasure or spirituality, or both? What’s the difference between her connection to a man and her connection to God? I just didn’t understand. What were these men doing on screen that made women sweat the way I watched the woman in church sweat and pass out after? I remember how limp her body became, how she could no longer move her limbs. People fanned her and brought water and towels.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Maybe this was how a good orgasm felt: </span>a spiritual experience that made your mind and body disconnect. Honestly, it sounded pretty nice to lose control and blame it on the Spirit. To be wrapped in a funk-filled perfume with no fear of consequences. Those strange noises I heard in church sounded just like a woman having a good orgasm, so maybe that too was a way of talking to God, of thanking him for the out-of-body experience she had as she climaxed. Despite all the scenes my mother tried to shield me from, I was beginning to understand that there were countless ways women could feel the Spirit: being overcome with passion. Praising, dancing, grinding, worshipping. Lovemaking. It was all the same freedom, the same head-back connection to something greater. Maybe that’s what my mother was afraid of me seeing— what happens when you relinquish control and just get free.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>In <i>The Guest, </i>poet and literary translator Robin Myers explores poetry translation as process, practice, vocation, meditation, and craft. Drawing both on her own projects-in-progress and the work of other translators, <i>The Guest </i>is a kind of diary, a thinking-out-loud about the pleasures, challenges, and decisions required—and invited—by bringing poems into another language. To do them justice and to make them new. </strong></p>
<hr />
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>The Way Out Is In</strong></h2>
<p>If you’re looking for a new source of stress in your life, may I suggest you try translating a sonnet? You’ll get to grapple not only with the constraints of the form itself (fourteen lines, iambic pentameter, one of several possible rhyme schemes), but also whatever other constraints the poet has imposed on their own work before you ever got your hands on it. The form will give you a road map to follow, as May Huang (featured in <a href="https://www.palettepoetry.com/2021/02/25/the-guest-11/">The Guest 11</a>) writes about <a href="https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/dispatches/article/on-sestinas-and-literary-translation-may-huang">translating sestinas</a>—but you’ll also have to draw a new map from scratch. No matter how hard it is, you’ll want to make it look easy, which will make it even harder. Like dancing in ankle weights.</p>
<p>Emma Rault, who translates from Dutch and German, is intimately familiar with this dance. She has been translating a sequence by the Flemish poet Kurt De Boodt, whose rich, dense poems are marked by sound play and formal limitations. (You can read the full translations <a href="https://www.flandersliterature.be/books-and-authors/book/wake">here, at Flanders Literature</a>.) Some are full-fledged sonnets; one is a “deconstructed sonnet”: “something that starts out as a traditional sonnet and then falls apart,” Emma tells me, “to mimic the mental disintegration of the character featured in the poem.”</p>
<p>I felt vicariously daunted by this challenge even before I’d read the poems themselves. Of course, translation always involves the struggle to find freedom within constraints: that’s the point. That’s the art. A deconstructed sonnet, though, means a whole other level of restrictions. How did this translator find her way out?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>By finding a way in. Emma says she thinks of translating poetry “as creating a chink in the poem, a crack that’s just small enough for me to slip through and ‘live inside it’…it helps to think of what I do as ‘trying to get the poem to open up,’ just sort of tapping away at its exterior.” I love this idea: the translator hovering outside a sealed object, a hermetic vessel, probing the surface until it yields and lets her through.</p>
<p>I also love the way the image helps de-romanticize translation as a craft. It sometimes bothers me how literary translation (especially poetry translation, considering how insistently poetry itself is romanticized) can be construed as an act of esoteric channeling. As if the translator gets beamed up into the spaceship of the poem and deposited back onto solid ground, translation magically in hand. Caught and released. Which isn’t to say that translation doesn’t involve moments of mystery, affinity, and intuition: thank goodness for those. But poems are made of words, and words are material to be labored with. That, too, is the point, and the art. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Emma’s labor begins, she describes, with a rough cut, an unvarnished, here-is-what-the-words-are-saying rendition of a line. “And then I just start trying to rephrase it and rephrase it, trying to get to the point where the artistry sneaks its way in there”: first on paper, then a round of editing triggered by the act of typing it up. Then pages and pages of free-associated notes: lists of similar words, alternate turns of phrase, possible formulations and reformulations. This is the tapping part. Tapping and tapping and tapping until the mysterious crack opens up: the quiet shift that tells a poet and translator <i>that’s the one. </i>Come in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Back to Kurt De Boodt’s deconstructed sonnet. This poem is called “Seam,” and it’s from a cycle about deterioration and recovery, both mental and physical, after World War One. “The central metaphor is a sewing machine,” Emma explains to me, “which may be repairing an item of clothing, or may be attempting to repair a person.” De Boodt has described the poem as a sonnet that falls apart: fourteen lines, with the first four lines having ten syllables each—</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 80px;">The Brother Contraption snores below us<br />
She&#8217;s wrapped in dreams of mending fraying thread.<br />
The rattle of her breath soothes nightmare demons<br />
into a hail of bowler-hatted heads.</p>
<p>—before the poem swerves in the second stanza, veering away from the original form. The effect is instantly destabilizing:</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 80px;">Brother waits<br />
Brother waits impatiently<br />
What Brother makes of you<br />
remains</p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 160px;">undone.<br />
undone.<br />
undone.</p>
<p>This stanza reads, in Dutch, <i>Brother [the sewing machine] wacht (&#8230;) / je herstel / niet af / niet af / niet af, </i>which means “Brother doesn’t wait for your recovery.” But in Dutch syntax, Emma tells me, “the ‘not’ is tacked on at the end, so the line break creates surprise: it sounds like Brother is waiting, and then it turns out the opposite is true.” Brother waits / for your recovery / not. What’s more: <i>niet af / niet af / niet af, </i>the repeated negation, is onomatopoeic, mimicking the sound of a sewing machine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Emma’s challenge, then, was to keep tapping until she found a way in English to convey not one but both of these critical elements: the delayed, subverted resolution of the line, and the rattle of the machine. These aren’t mere devices in the poem. They <i>are </i>the poem: they help enact both the subject’s disintegration and the sonnet’s. Form follows function, as the saying goes.</p>
<p>So Emma tapped and tapped, repeating variations of the line to herself throughout the day, especially while cooking (I can relate to this tactic!), until she stumbled into the word “undone.” It was perfect for <i>niet af</i>, “for the surprise at the end, because it means unfinished, and there’s also the sense of ‘coming undone’ as in having a mental breakdown, and it was the closest to that sewing-machine sound that I was going to get. I knew I could come up with a line that ended on that word… I just had to find my way there.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>As I revisited my conversation with Emma to write this column, I found myself thinking of a word I love in Mexican Spanish: “talacha.” An etymological amalgam between the Náhuatl “tlalli” (land) and the Spanish “hacha”<i> </i>(axe), a talacha is a tool: a mattock, used for digging and prying by hand, for loosening hard ground, for pulling up stalks and roots. Today, though, the word is also used in reference to maintenance or repair, especially for cars. And it can invoke any kind of small-scale, hand-executed, slow-and-steady kind of labor.<i> </i>“Talachear” or “hacer talacha” conjures a general sense of plugging away, keeping at it, getting something done a little at a time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A translator is an artist, but an artist is also an artisan. This, I’d like to think, is what we talk about when we talk about craft—or at least it’s how I want to talk about it, and what thrills me about how Emma does. Talacha: tap-tap-tapping against a poem, exploring what it’s made of, learning what we can make with what’s inside.</p>
